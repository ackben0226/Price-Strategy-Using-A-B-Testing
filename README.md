# Price-Strategy-Using-A-B-Testing
## __Can Pricing Strategy Make or Break a Business?__

Pricing is one of the most critical levers a business can pull to influence revenue, profitability, and customer behavior. But how do businesses determine the right pricing strategy? Inspired by my interest in data-driven decision-making, I embarked on this project to explore the impact of discounts, price increases, and bundling strategies using A/B testing.

Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, I aimed to answer key questions:

- __Do discounts drive higher revenue, or do they simply erode profit margins?__
- __Can a small price increase be implemented without losing customers?__
- __Does bundling products encourage more purchases, or do customers prefer flexibility?__

## __Project Overview__
This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of a discount-based pricing strategy using A/B testing, alongside exploring the impact of price increases and bundling strategies. The primary objective is to determine whether offering a discount (e.g., 10% off) or increasing the price (e.g., 10% higher) leads to measurable changes in revenue and purchase behavior across different product categories. Additionally, we investigate whether bundling products can enhance sales performance compared to selling items individually.

## __Actions:__ 
1. __Data Collection and Preparation__
   - Collected sales transaction data, including product categories, pricing, quantity sold, and revenue.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring high data quality for analysis.
2. ## __Experimental Design__
   - Designed A/B tests to evaluate three pricing strategies:
      - __Discount Strategy:__
        - Group A (Control): No discount applied.
        - Group B (Test): 10% discount applied.
      - __Price Increase Sensitivity:__
         - Group A (Control): Original pricing maintained.
         - Group B (Test): 10% price increase applied.
3. ## __Bundling Strategy:__
   - Created bundled product groups and compared their sales performance against individual item sales.
4. ## __Revenue Adjustment and Statistical Analysis__
   - Computed adjusted revenue for each group to account for discounts and price changes.
   - Conducted statistical hypothesis testing (t-test) to determine if revenue differences between groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
   - Analyzed key metrics such as conversion rates, average order value, and customer purchase behavior.

5. ## __Data Visualization and Insights:__
6. Created visualizations using Tableau to compare revenue trends and customer behavior across groups.

Identified patterns in product category performance and highlighted actionable insights for optimizing pricing strategies.

Results Summary
Discount Strategy: The 10% discount led to a 15% increase in sales volume but only a 5% increase in revenue, suggesting a trade-off between volume and profit margins.

Price Increase Sensitivity: The 10% price increase resulted in a 3% drop in sales volume but a 7% increase in revenue, indicating that customers were relatively price-insensitive.

Bundling Strategy: Bundled products saw a 20% higher average order value compared to individual item sales, demonstrating the effectiveness of bundling in driving higher revenue.
