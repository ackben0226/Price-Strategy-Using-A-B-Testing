# Price-Strategy-Using-A-B-Testing
__Can Pricing Strategy Make or Break a Business?__

Pricing is one of the most critical levers a business can pull to influence revenue, profitability, and customer behavior. But how do businesses determine the right pricing strategy? Inspired by my interest in data-driven decision-making, I embarked on this project to explore the impact of discounts, price increases, and bundling strategies using A/B testing.

Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, I aimed to answer key questions:

- __Do discounts drive higher revenue, or do they simply erode profit margins?__
- __Can a small price increase be implemented without losing customers?__
- __Does bundling products encourage more purchases, or do customers prefer flexibility?__
